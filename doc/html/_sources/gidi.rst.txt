Generalized Interaction Data Interface (GIDI)
=============================================

GIDI is a C++ API for reading (and eventually writing) GNDS files. It is being developed at LLNL,
and is used by the LLNL codes Mercury (Monte Carlo transport) and ARDRA (deterministic transport).
An older version of GIDI has also been released as part of the G4LEND package in GEANT4.

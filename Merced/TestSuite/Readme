This directory contains test files and sample output for the getTransferMatrix code.

Note: The following parameters may be set in the input file or on the
command line.
  skip_logging # default  0       // if == 1, don't log errors in documentation.txt file
  message_level # default 0       // three levels of messages - info, warn and severe
                                // info = 0 (all messages written)
                                // warn = 1 (only warnings and errors)
                                // severe >=2 (errors only, these cause exits anyway!)
  datafield_precision # default 8 // 8 sig-figs in all data fields
  quad_tol # default  0.0001  // relative error in the quadrature
  abs_quad_tol # default  1.0e-8  // absolute error in the quadrature
  check_row_sum # default  1   // if > 0, check the sums over each row
  E_tol # default  1.0e-9   // tolerance on hitting the corner of an energy box
  abs_tol # default  2.0e-14   // absolute tolerance if E = 0
For example:
quad_tol: 1.0e-6 # in the input file or
-quad_tol 1.0e-6 # in the command line

Parameters used only by coherent and Compton scattering:
  Thompson # default  0.6652448    // cross section for Thompson scattering (barns)
  # to rescale x from 1/cm to MeV: multiply by 2*pi*c*hbar
  double cminv_to_MeV = 6.2831853071795862*2.99792458e+02*6.58212200e-14;
  cminv_to_MeV # default  cminv_to_MeV

Parameters used only by Compton scattering:
  m_electron # default  0.511   // electron mass
  Compton_cutoff # default  1.0e-6   // when is mu approx 1 for Compton scattering

Input and output files are given only on the command line
  input # default   ""
  output # default   "utfil"
  path_to_input # default  "."
For example:
getTransferMatrix -output somefile.out somefile


The data is organized into subdirectories according to the type of data given.

*** Traditional ENDL data:

doubleDifferential: table of angular probability density for an outgoing
  particle in the laboratory frame together with a table of joint
  energy-angle probability density.  This is traditional ENDL I=1 data
  along with I=3 data.

isotropic: a table of energy probability density for an outgoing particle,
  isotropic in the laboratory frame.

Legendre: a table of Legendre coefficients for the energy probability density
  of an outgoing particle in the laboratory frame.  This is traditional ENDL
  I=4 data.

twoBody: for discrete 2-body reactions this data is a table of angular
  probability densities in the center-of-mass frame.  The reaction may be
  elastic or inelastic (with an excited residual).  This is traditional
  ENDL I=1 data.

uncorrelated: tables of uncorrelated energy and angle probability
  densities for an outgoing particle.  This is traditional ENDL I=1 data
  along with I=4 data of Legendre order 0.

*** Models used in ENDF which are not in ENDL:

captureGamma: data for special relativistic treatment of gamma as the
  product of capture as a discrete 2-body reaction.

ENDFdoubleDiff: ENDF-style table of joint energy-angle probability density
  in the labaoratory frame. 

ENDFLegendre: Legendre expansions of energy-angle probability density
  in the labaoratory frame.  The data is ordered according to ENDF rules.

evaporation: energy distribution as an evaporation spectrum.

GeneralEvaporation: data for energy probability densities of delayed fission
  neutrons.  This data is independent of the energy of the incident neutron.

Kalbach: data for the Kalbach-Mann model for energy-angle probability density
  in the center-of-mass coordinate system.

Legendre2Body: angular probability densities for discrete 2-body reactions
  given as Legendre expansions.  The data is in the center-of-mass frame.

Madland: data for the Madland-Nix model for fission neutrons.

phaseSpace: data for the N-body phase-space model for energy probability density
  in the center-of-mass coordinate system.

Maxwell: data for the Maxwell model for fission neutrons.

Watt: data for the Watt model for fission neutrons.

weights: data files to test the handling of model weights.  This feature
  is typically used for one neutron in an (n, 2n) reaction or for multiple
  interpolation regions.

*** EPDL photon data:

coherent: The form factor for coherent scattering.

Compton: The scattering factor for Compton scattering.

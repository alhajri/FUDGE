The files in this subdirectory contain data for energy probability
density for fission neutrons given as the Watt model.  Three quadrature 
schemes are used, as illustrated by the input files:

in.Watt-U233: The default uses adaptive quadrature for both incident energy
  and outgoing energy.  Its output file is out.Watt-U233.

in.Watt-U233.Gauss6: The same data but with 6-th order Gaussian quadrature.
  Its output file is out.Watt-U233.Gauss6.

Watt-U233.interp: For this data the integrals over outgoing energy
  are done separately using adaptive quadrature, and their values are 
  interpolated when integrating over incident energy.  The  output file 
  is out.Watt-U233.interp.  This method is deprecated.

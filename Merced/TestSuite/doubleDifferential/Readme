The data in this subdirectory is traditional ENDL I=3 double-differential
energy-angle probability densities for outgoing particles.  The code first
converts the data to ENDF Legendre expansions of the energy-angle probability
densities, and this is done using Gaussian quadrature.  The "Quadrature method"
in the input files refers to how the ENDF Legendre expansions are integrated
over the energy bins.  

*** Warning: because the code first converts the data to Legendre    ***
*** expansions, interpolation between different values of the cosine ***
*** is necessarily direct.                                    ***

The input files are as follows:

in.doubleDiff-Fe57: Uses the default adaptive quadrature.  The output file is
  out.doubleDiff-Fe57.

in.doubleDiff-Fe57.Gauss4: Uses 4th-order Gaussian quadrature.  The output file is
  out.doubleDiff-Fe57.Gauss4.
